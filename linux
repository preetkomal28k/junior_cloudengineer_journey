### What I did today

- Explored the Linux terminal for the first time
- Understood the basic structure of the Linux file system
- install the linux using vmware

### What is Linux
Linux is an open-source operating system used in servers, cloud platforms, and DevOps environments.  
It is fast, secure, and highly customizable, which makes it important for cloud engineers.

### Commands I practiced
- `pwd` – to check the current directory
- `ls` – to list files and folders
- `cd` – to move between directories
- `mkdir` -  to create directory
- `rm` - remove directory
- `cp` - copy file or directory
- `mv` - can move any directory to folder  (mv file /folder)
- `ls-l` - 	check preference table
- `clear` - clear the screen 

### What I learned
- Linux uses a command-line interface to interact with the system
- Everything in Linux is treated as a file
- Directories help organize files in a structured way

### Challenges faced
- Remembering directory paths while using `cd`

### Tomorrow’s plan
- Start the Bandit wargame
- Learn how to connect using SSH

### TIP
Don’t be afraid of the terminal. Making mistakes is part of learning Linux.
