## Day 1 – Introduction to Linux

### What I did today
- Learned what Linux is and why it is widely used
- Explored the Linux terminal for the first time
- Understood the basic structure of the Linux file system
- install the linux using vmware

### What is Linux
Linux is an open-source operating system used in servers, cloud platforms, and DevOps environments.  
It is fast, secure, and highly customizable, which makes it important for cloud engineers.

### Commands I practiced
- `pwd` – to check the current directory
- `ls` – to list files and folders
- `cd` – to move between directories
- `mkdir` -  to create directory
- `rm` - remove directory
- `cp` - copy file or directory
- `mv` - can move any directory to folder  (mv file /folder)
- `ls-l` - 	check preference table
- `clear` - clear the screen 

### What I learned
- Linux uses a command-line interface to interact with the system
- Everything in Linux is treated as a file
- Directories help organize files in a structured way

### Challenges faced
- Remembering directory paths while using `cd`

### Tomorrow’s plan
- Start the Bandit wargame
- Learn how to connect using SSH

### TIP
Don’t be afraid of the terminal. Making mistakes is part of learning Linux.


## Day 2 – Linux Folder Structure & Bandit Wargame

### What I did today
- Learned about Linux folder structure
- Tried to understand how directories are organized
- Solved initial levels of the Bandit wargame
- Practiced basic Linux commands while solving Bandit

### Linux folder structure 
Today I learned that Linux follows a structured directory system.
At first, it felt confusing, but with practice it started making sense.

Some important directories I noticed:
- `/` – root directory (starting point)
- `/home` – stores user files
- `/etc` – configuration files
- `/bin` and `/usr/bin` – system commands

### Understanding `/proc` (process information)

- `/proc` is a **virtual directory**
- It does not store real files on disk
- It shows information about **running processes and system status**

What I understood:
- Each running process has a folder inside `/proc`
- Process information changes dynamically
- It helps in monitoring system activity

This concept was a bit confusing at first, but I understood that `/proc` helps Linux show live system information.

Right now, it still feels a bit confusing, but I understand that with time and practice, things will become clearer.

### Bandit wargame progress
- Started Bandit using SSH
- Solved beginner levels
- Learned how passwords are hidden inside files

### Commands I practiced
- `ls`
- `cd`
- `cat`
- `pwd`
- `ssh`

### What I learned
- Linux directory structure is important to understand the system
- Bandit helps in learning Linux through practical challenges
- Reading files and navigating directories is a core Linux skill

### Challenges faced
- Folder structure was confusing initially
- Remembering paths while switching directories

### Tip for myself
- It’s okay if everything doesn’t make sense immediately

### Tomorrow’s plan
- Solve more Bandit levels
- Practice file permissions and basic commands
