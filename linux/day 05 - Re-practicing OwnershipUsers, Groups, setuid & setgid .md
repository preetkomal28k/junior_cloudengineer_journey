## Day 5 – Re-practicing Ownership, Users, Groups, setuid & setgid

<b><i> Getting confused is part of learning Linux. Some concepts take time to understand, especially permissions and ownership. Repeating topics and practicing with real commands helps build clarity.
With consistent hands-on practice, confusion gradually turns into confidence.</i> </b>


### What I did today
- Felt confused about setuid and setgid concepts
- Repeated Day 4 topics for better understanding
- Practiced creating users and groups again
- Re-worked ownership and permission examples
- Focused more on hands-on practice than theory

### Revisiting Day 4 concepts
Today I realized that I was still confused about **setuid** and **setgid**.
Instead of moving forward, I decided to **repeat Day 4 work**.

Revisiting the same concepts helped me understand them more clearly.

### Creating users and groups (practice)
I practiced creating test users and groups to understand ownership better.

Commands used:
```bash
useradd testuser
groupadd testgroup
  ```
###  Practice questions I worked on

Why do setuid and setgid behave differently?
Why does setuid work only on executables?
How does group inheritance work in directories?
What security risks exist with special permissions?

### Commands I practiced

- `useradd`
- `groupadd`
- `usermod`
- `id`
- `groups`
- `chown`
- `chmod`
- `ls -l`

### What I learned

It’s normal to feel confused with special permissions
Repeating practice improves understanding
Users and groups are essential for permissions
Hands-on work is the best way to learn Linux

### Challenges faced

- Understanding permission behavior clearly
- Remembering multiple commands
- Connecting theory with real examples

### Tip

If a concept feels confusing, repeat it.
Revisiting topics is part of real learning, not a setback.
